# Activity Data Tracker App

## Description

This app is created so a user may login and enter information from completed athletic activities. It is primarily geared towards running right now, and may be expanded for other activities in the future. The user can put in activity stats, such as length of time, distance, split time, calories, etc. They can then search the data to find the longest time, fartherst distance, fastest mile, or average pace. The user can "favorite" a particular run that was good, or delete one. The home page identifies the logged in user and their fastest mile time so far.

This app was build for phase-4 at Flatiron School. The goal is to use a React app frontend with a Rails API backend using full CRUD actions, then deploy that app using Heroku.

## Tools

- Ruby 2.7.4
- NodeJS (v16), and npm
- Heroku CLI
- Postgresql
